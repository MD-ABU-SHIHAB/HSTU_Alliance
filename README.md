## Introduction

### Background

The **HSTU Alliance** project was initiated to modernize the way students access and manage their university-related information. Traditionally, managing student data involved manual processes or complicated database systems, which led to inefficiencies. This project aims to simplify the process with a user-friendly and efficient system.

### Problem Statement

Educational institutions, including HSTU, face challenges in managing student information effectively due to outdated or complex data management systems. These can result in errors, slow data retrieval, and administrative overhead. **HSTU Alliance** addresses these issues by implementing a local file-based system for efficient student data management.

### Significance

- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Students can easily access their information without administrative intervention.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Reduces the need for expensive database systems.
- **Efficiency**: Simplifies administrative tasks, allowing staff to focus on more critical responsibilities.

### Scope

Key features of the project include:
- User account creation and secure login.
- Categorized data access (e.g., zones, halls, and faculty information).
- Local file storage for student data.
- Basic security measures for user authentication.

### Objectives

**Primary Objectives:**
- Develop a user-friendly system for managing student information without complex databases.
- Provide secure access to student data with a simple login mechanism.

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Enhance information accessibility for students.
- Automate key administrative processes to reduce workload.

## Methodology

### Development Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Java with JavaFX for GUI.
- **File Handling**: Java's file handling for data storage.
- **Development Environment**: IntelliJ IDEA for coding and debugging.

### System Design

The system uses a file-based architecture, allowing efficient data handling without relying on databases. The design includes:
- A user-friendly JavaFX interface.
- Local file storage for data management.

### Implementation Process

1. **Planning**: Requirements gathering and architecture design.
2. **Development**: Creating the interface and backend logic.
3. **Testing**: Debugging and validating functionality.
4. **Deployment**: Launching the system for users.

## System Overview
